# Cut Buddy Template

This is a barebones static web template: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with no frameworks or build tooling. Use it as a blank canvas for future iterations.
For the full product direction, see [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md); keep it updated as the project evolves.


## Structure
- `index.html` — minimal markup with a header and placeholder section.
- `styles/main.css` — baseline styling that centers content and sets a neutral system font.
- `scripts/app.js` — empty script stub that simply logs a readiness message.

## Running Locally
Any static server will do, e.g.
```bash
cd /Users/brendan/dev/cut-buddy
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Then open `http://localhost:8080`.
